Based on Deathloop, taking inspiration from it's outstanding UI

personally edited by techno to fix some things, add some QoL and improve the 4:3 compatibility a bit (this hud was already 99% compatible with 4:3 to begin with.)

> [!NOTE]
> ~~This hud only supports 16:9 and isn't tested on linux so use on your own discretion but please dont report bugs to me if you dont play on 16:9 or windows.~~
>
> this fork and branch (`personal`) supports 4:3. i didn't bother fixing inventory though so good lukc
